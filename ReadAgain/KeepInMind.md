# Keep In Mind and remember that...

* You have to handle every situation in the best way possible
	- Incluso en el peor de los momentos tienes que pensar de la mejor manera, a pesar del miedo, la presion. 
	-

* You must be ablle to keep ur mint where u want, concentrate in a performance
	- Keep ur mint in your goal: clearly define ur goals and objectives
	- Improve ur ability-capacity to resist distractions and maintain(mantenerte) focus on what really matters to achieve ur goals.
	- The most important is the process, not just the result, enjoy and love the journey(camino recorrido), attention should be focused on how u r performing(on como estas realizando) a task rather(en lugar) than worrying exclusively about the result.

* Life is a trip, learn so much from the wise as of fools. Life is full of the oportunities, EVERY second and every decision points you in a new direction.
	- But life and time are temporary: TAKE it into account and TAKE CARE OF IT!
