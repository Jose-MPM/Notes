# Mind
* You must be ablle to keep ur mint where u want, concentrate in a performance
	- Keep ur mint in your goal: clearly define ur goals and objectives
	- Improve ur ability-capacity to resist distractions and maintain(mantenerte) focus on what really matters to achieve ur goals.
	- The most important is the process, not just the result, enjoy and love the journey(camino recorrido), attention should be focused on how u r performing(on como estas realizando) a task rather(en lugar) than worrying exclusively about the result.

- Blame the outsider? Take care of ur inner self because u r the problem.
	- Culpas al externo? cuida tu yo interno, porque el problema eres tu.	

- Create a values system according to what u r looking for(crea un sistema de valores acorde a lo que buscas).
	- why do u believe that u believe?
		- por que crees lo que crees?

- to do:
	- Observe u from the outside, as if u were an outsider to see what bothers u about others.
	- Check-Revisit ur pass and resolve ur childhood traumas
	- We suffer because of what we think people think of u
		- Prepare u for the criticism, it's not up(depend) to u.
		- U are not important, people live their lives, they don't spend a lot of time thinking about u, sorry.
		- Take it with humor, I guess other don't know my flaws (others defects) or they would say worse things.
	- Do not assume, u will wrong

## Personal Develop

* Imagine that u have done it before, that u have succeeded in this, how would u act if u had already succeeded? As if u were already successful, be consistent with that emotional state
	- TRUST ON U! U CAN, I feel perfect to give it my all-do it very well
	- Concentrate on makingur first better hit-succeed

* Handle the stress, this it nothing....
* Enjoy when u r beaing happy, but when u r going through something bad, stand firm.
