## Introduction to Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing

* Objective: Explain the importance of methodological ethical hacking and penetration testing.

* hay que seguir una metodología para lograr eficiencia.

* Understanding Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing: 
	- An ethical hacker’s goal is to analyze the security posture of a network’s or system’s infrastructure in an effort to identify and possibly exploit any security weaknesses found and then determine if a compromise is possible. This process is called security penetration testing or ethical hacking.

* why do we need to do penetration testing? 
	- But how do we know if those defenses really work and whether they are enough to keep out the bad guys? How valuable is the data that we are protecting, and are we protecting the right things? These are some of the questions that should be answered by a penetration test. 

	- Depending on what you are protecting, you might also want razor wire on the top of the fence to deter the bad guys even more. 
		- When it comes to information security, we need to do the same type of assessments on our networks and systems. We need to determine what it is we are protecting and whether our defenses can hold up to the threats that are imposed on them. This is where penetration testing comes in. 
		- Simply implementing a firewall, an IPS, anti-malware, a VPN, a web application firewall (WAF), and other modern security defenses **isn’t enough**. You also need to test their validity. And you need to do this on a regular basis. 
		
	- As you know, networks and systems change constantly. This means the attack surface can change as well, and when it does, you need to consider reevaluating the security posture by way of a penetration test.

* The process of completing a penetration test varies based on many factors. The tools and techniques used to assess the security posture of a network or system also vary. The network and systems being evaluated r often highly complex. FOr this it's very ez when performing a penetration test to go off scope. This is were testing methodologies come in.

- Types of penetration test
	- Network Infrastructure Tests
		- Include:  switches, routers, firewalls, and supporting resources, such as authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) servers  and IPS's
			- IPS
	- Application-Based Tests
		- include: misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, logic flaws, access to the database through the web application compromise.
		- OWASP
	- Penetration Testing in the Cloud
		- 
	 - Social-Engineer Toolkit SET

- environments
	- uknown environments - black box
		- very limited amount of information provides to simulate the perspective and an attack from a external attacker.
			- domain name, IP addressed, 
		-  **the scope may be only to identify a path into the organization and stop there**
	- known environments - white box
		- significant amount of information about the organization and infrastructure provides like a network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations and a set of user credentials. 
		- The scope is much broader and includes internal network configuration auditing and scanning of desktop computers for defects
	- partially known environments  - gray(grei) box

	- is a comprehensive guide focused on web application testing. It is a compilation of many years of work by OWASP members. OWASP WSTG covers the high-level phases of web application security testing and digs deeper into the testing methods used. For instance, it goes as far as providing attack vectors for testing cross-site scripting (XSS), XML external entity (XXE) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection attacks; as well as how to prevent and mitigate these attacks.

- Special Publication (SP) 800-115 is a document created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
	- ESTANDAR PARA LAS PRUEBAS DE PENETRACIÓN
	- NIST SP 800-115 provides organizations with guidelines on planning and conducting information security testing. It superseded the previous standard document, SP 800-42. SP 800-115 is considered an industry standard for penetration testing guidance and is called out in many other industry standards and documents. You can access NIST SP 800-115 at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final.

- the OSSTMM is a document that lays(establece) out repeatable and consistent security testing
	-     Operational Security Metrics
    - Trust Analysis
    - Work Flow
    - Human Security Testing
    - Physical Security Testing
    - Wireless Security Testing
    - Telecommunications Security Testing
    - Data Networks Security Testing
    - Compliance Regulations
    - Reporting with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR)

- The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) (http://www.pentest-standard.org) provides information about types of attacks and methods, and it provides information on the latest tools available to accomplish the testing methods outlined. PTES involves seven distinct phases:
    - Pre-engagement interactions
    - Intelligence gathering(recopilación)
    - Threat modeling
    - Vulnerability analysis
    - Exploitation
    - Post-exploitation
    - Reporting

- The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is another penetration testing methodology similar to the others on this list with some additional phases. ISSAF covers the following phases:
    - Information gathering
    - Network mapping
    - Vulnerability identification
    - Penetration
    - Gaining access and privilege escalation
    - Enumerating further(enumeración adicional)
    - Compromising remote users/sites
    - Maintaining access
    - Covering the tracks
