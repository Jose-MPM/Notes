# CARTA

I'm writing to express my interest in the Junior Cybersecurity Specialist position at your  organization. With a strong academic background in Computer Science from the Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM, and a passion for cybersecurity, I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team.

During my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and cybersecurity concepts. I have experience in full-stack development, cryptology, operating systems, and computer networks. My involvement in projects such as the development of a Banking Simulator during the BBVA 2023 Hackathon and my contributions to cybersecurity dissemination projects have provided me with a solid foundation in both practical and theoretical aspects of cybersecurity.

While I may not have formal work experience in cybersecurity, I have demonstrated my commitment to the field through various training courses and certifications. I'm currently enhancing my specialization through an Ethical Hacking course by Cisco and have been awarded a scholarship for Google's 'Cybersecurity 2024' course. These experiences have equipped me with knowledge in identity governance, authentication systems, and incident management.

My role as a Teacher Assistant at UNAM allowed me to develop strong organizational and communication skills, as well as the ability to work effectively in a team. I was part of the team that organized and managed the 1st Philosophy of Computing Symposium, which involved coordinating logistics for a large number of attendees and online participants.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it aligns with my career goals in cybersecurity although I would actually like to practice in pentesting. I am confident that my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and eagerness to learn will make me a valuable asset to your team. Your next HIPO. I am highly motivated and committed to contributing to the success of your organization while continuously developing my skills in cybersecurity.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached at 5548967650 or via email at jose_manuel@ciencias.unam.mx.

Sincerely José Manuel Pedro Méndez
