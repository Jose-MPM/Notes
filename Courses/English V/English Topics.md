## Pronunciation
* Pronunciation of "y"
    - The “y” can be a consonant or a vowel. The consonant sound of “y” is /y/ as in the word “yellow”. Typically at the beginning of the word the “y” makes the consonant /y/ sound. 
        * _union_[junjɛn]
        * _usually_ [juʒl̩i]
        * coupon [kjupɑn] al inicio muy despacio
    - The “y” also has two vowel sounds. Typically.
        * In a one syllable word the “y” at the end of the word makes the long “i” sound as in the following words: cry, fry, try.
        * Typically, in a two syllable word, the “y” at the end of the word makes a long “e” soundas in baby and city.
* Pronunciation of "ʤ"
    - The /ʤ/ sound is made through the mouth and it is Voiced which means that you vibrate your vocal chords to make the sound. It is defined by shape of your lips and the position of your tongue and it is an affricate, which is a sound made by closing the air flow but then opening it by forcing air through a narrow space. In this case it is the tip of your tongue that creates the narrow space between it and the ridge behind the teeth. To produce the sound touch your tongue to that ridge lightly and allow air pressure to force the tongue down whilst voicing out.
    
    The /ʤ/ phoneme is normally spelled with the letter ‘j’ as in the word:
        • just /dʒəst/
        • religion /rɪlɪʤən/
        • judge /ʤʌʤ/
        • major /ˈmeɪdʒə/
