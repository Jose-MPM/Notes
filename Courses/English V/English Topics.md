## Pronunciation
* The schwa sound /ə/.
    - communication-cəmunicəshion
    - traditional-trədicəonal
    - diet/dait/
    - The reduced vowel sound[El sonido vocalico reducido] called schwa is the most common vowel sound in spoken English. Schwa is a quick, relaxed, neutral vowel pronunciation very close to a _'short u'_ /ʌ/.  [Schawa es una pronunciación vocalica rapida, relajada y neutra muy cercana a]
    - The purpose of schwa is to allow unstressed syllables to be said more quickly so the main beats of spoken words are easier to place on the stressed syllables. [El proposito de schwa es permitirnos que las silabas no acentuadas se digar más rapidamente para que el sonido principal de las palabras habladas sean más fáciles de colocar en las silabas acentuadas.]
    - Schwa does not have an exact and standard pronunciation. Due to the near-identical pronunciation of schwa and short u, [Debido a la pronunciación casi idéntica de] many dictionaries merge[fusionan] the transcription of the two sounds and strictly use /ə/.
    - Separate symbols are retained[Los símbolos se mantienen separados aquí para indicar] here to indicate whether a vowel sound falls on a stressed or unstressed syllable[Cae en una silaba acentuada o no acentuada]. 
    - Schwa occurs in two different circumstances: [Se produce en]
        1. in an unstressed syllable of a multi-syllable word
        2. as a reduced vowel sound in a function word [Como un sonido vocalico reducido en una palabra funcional]

    * ### Schwa in an unstressed syllable    

        *  In words with more than one syllable, not every syllable is given equal emphasis when spoken. Three levels of *syllable stress*[acento silábico] are possible: [no todas las silabas reciben el mismo énfasis cuando las hablamos]

            1. stressed /⬤/
            2. secondarily stressed /●/
            3. unstressed /•/

        * Every multi-syllable word has a single[única] stressed syllable. The single stressed syllable of the word has the most emphasis. The remainder[resto] of the syllables may have a secondary stress[acento secundario] or may be unstressed[pueden ser no acentuadas]. The word emphasize[acentuada] has all the levels of stress.[niveles de acento].

        * The word emphasize has all the levels of stress. The first syllable is stressed, the second syllable is an unstressed syllable pronounced as schwa, and the third syllable has a secondary stress.
            * em•pha•size
            * /⬤ • ●/
    * ### The spellings of Schwa

        - Many multi-syllable words do not seem to be pronounced as they are spelled.[no parecen ser pronunciadas como se escriben] This is because schwa is a function of syllable stress and not of spelling[Es una función del acento silábico y no de la ortografía]. Once learners can recognize stressed syllables, it becomes easier to predict when schwa will be used in an adjacent, unstressed vowel[será más facil predecir cuando se usara _Schwa_ en una vocal adyacente no acentuada.], regardless of the spelling.[Independientemente de la ortografía]

        - The examples below show schwa as it is exhibited when spelled with each vowel. They syllable containing schwa is bolded:
            + 'a' spelling:
                - **a**gain: /ə 'gɛn/
                - vit**a**min: /'vɑɪ t̬ə mɪn/
            + 'e' spelling:
                - p*e*tition: /pə ˈtɪʃ ən/
                - cel*e*brate: /ˈsɛl ə breɪt/
            + 'i' spelling
                - pres*i*dent: /ˈprɛz ə dɛnt/
                - exper*i*ment: /ɪk 'spɛr ə mənt/
            + 'o' spelling
                - occur: /ə 'kɚ/
                - condition: /kən ˈdɪʃ ən/ 
            + 'u' spelling
                - campus: /ˈkæm pəs/
                - support: /sə ˈpɔrt/


* ban[ban], track[track], **lane[lein]**
* auction/o:chion/[subasta], receipt[ricipt], click[click]

* Pronunciation of "y"
    - The “y” can be a consonant or a vowel. The consonant sound of “y” is /y/ as in the word “yellow”. Typically at the beginning of the word the “y” makes the consonant /y/ sound. 
        * _union_[junjɛn]
        * _usually_ [juʒl̩i]
        * coupon [kjupɑn] al inicio muy despacio
    - The “y” also has two vowel sounds. Typically.
        * In a one syllable word the “y” at the end of the word makes the long “i” sound as in the following words: cry, fry, try.
        * Typically, in a two syllable word, the “y” at the end of the word makes a long “e” soundas in baby and city.
* Pronunciation of "ʤ"
    - The /ʤ/ sound is made through the mouth and it is Voiced which means that you vibrate your vocal chords to make the sound. It is defined by shape of your lips and the position of your tongue and it is an affricate, which is a sound made by closing the air flow but then opening it by forcing air through a narrow space. In this case it is the tip of your tongue that creates the narrow space between it and the ridge behind the teeth. To produce the sound touch your tongue to that ridge lightly and allow air pressure to force the tongue down whilst voicing out.
    
    The /ʤ/ phoneme is normally spelled with the letter ‘j’ as in the word:
        • just /dʒəst/
        • religion /rɪlɪʤən/
