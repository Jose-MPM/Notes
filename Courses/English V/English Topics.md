## U5M2 Extreme comparison 36:22

* Topics:
    - Superlative:
        + Adjectives are words that help us to describe.
        + We use Superatives + Adjectives to compare a person or a thing with all of the group they are in.
    - Rules:
        1. We use _the_ + a superlative adjective, we use "the" before the superlative adjective 'cause we are referring to one specific person or thing.

            + This house is the most expensive.
            + This is the best price.
        2. With short adjectives: We make the superlative form of adjectives of one syllable by adding –est:
            + tall → the tallest
            + cheap → the cheapest
        3. If the adjective ends in –e, we add –st:
            + nice → the nicest
        4. If the adjective ends in one vowel and one consonant, we double the consonant and add –est:
            + big →the biggest
            + hot → the hottest
        5. Long adjectives: If the adjective ends in –y, change the y to i and add –est:
            + pretty → the prettiest
            + happy → the happiest
        6. Pay attention to some a few forms which are irregular
            + good → best
            + bad → worst
                - In my opinion, she is the best actress in Hollywood.
            + far → the furthest
            + Also note the irregular comparative and superlative forms of the quantifiers little, much and many:

                + little → the least
                + much **→** the most+
                + many → the most

        7. Two-syllable adjectives ending in "er","le" or "ow" we usually add -est.
            + clever-cleverest[inteligente, habil, astuto]
                - Luis is the cleverest person that I've ever met.
            + gentle-gentlest[suave,tierno]
            + narrow-narrowes[estrecho]

    - SUPERLATIVES AND PRESENT PERFECT WITH EVER.
        + What´s the tallest building that you have ever visited ?
        + What´s the most delicious dish that you have ever tasted ?
    
        The Present Perfect is used in two ways:
        1. Experiences and finished actions: Remember that we do not use a specific time.
        2. Unfinished actions: Things that started in the past but are not finished.
    
        We can combine the present perfect with superlative sentences to talk about both experiences and unfinished actions: [▪] We can also switch the order of the sentence.
        - Batman is the best movie that I have seen → The best movie that I have seen is Batman.
        - Korean beef is the best meat that I have eaten → The best meat that I have esaten is the Korean beef.
        - This book is the worst book that I’ve read → The worst book that I've read is this book.
        - She is the nicest teacher I have had → The nicest teacher I've had is her.

        Remember the word “that” in these sentences is optional.
        - He is the tallest man that I’ve seen = He is the tallest man I’ve seen.
        - Itzel is the most wonderful girl that I've ever met = Itzel is the most wonderful girl I've ever met

        We can mention recent experiences and life experiences.
        - It is the best movie that I have seen recently.
        - It is the best movie that I have seen. (In my whole life)
        - It is the best movie that I have seen in my life.

        We can add the word "ever" to emphasize. It just makes our sentence stronger and We can only use "ever" when talking about whole life experiences[Experiencias de toda la vida]. It cannot be used to talk only about recent experiences. No se puede solo utilizar para hablar sólo de experiencias recientes. Men[men-hombres]
        - He the most handsome man[maen-hombre] that I have ever seen.
        - It is the biggest waterfall[cascada] that I’ve ever seen.
        - The best singer that I have ever seen in concert is Adele
        
        We usually use the present tense “be verbs” in this sentence, but sometimes people use past tense “be verbs”. However, the two sentences below, have the same meaning.
        - It was the most interesting movie that I have ever seen.
        - It is the most interesting movie that I have ever seen.
    
    - Modify the superlative:
        + "one of the" + superlative + plurar noun
            - Great Britain is one of the richest countries in the wordl
                + Meaning: There are several very rich countries in the world and Great Britain is one of those countries.
        + "some of the" + superlative + plurar noun
            - NY, London and Tokio are some of the most expensive cities in the wordl
                + Meaning: There are several very expensive cities in the world and these are some of those cities.
        + We can also modify a superlative with a ordinal number: "the" + ordinal number + superlative
            - cardinal number - ordinal number:

## U6M1  Future actions(predictions, promises, decisions and offerings)

* Topics:
    - Will Video:

    - Will
        * Will has a neutral meaning but we use it to talk about facts in the future:
            - The spaceship will come down in the Pacific ocean tomorrow morning.
        * Assumptions based in what we think:
            - I think I'll pass he exam next Thursday.
        * We use will / won ́t + base form for future predictions, i.e. to say things we think,guess or know about the future.
            1. We often use I think / I don ́t think + will.
                + I think he'll fail the exam. I don't think hel'll pass the exam.
            2. We use probably to say that something is not definite: To say that something is not define, use probably with will for the future.
                + We'll propably visit the planet
            3. With positive contractions _will_ becomes _'ll_ and is joined to subject:
                + Subject + will/'ll + infinitive
                    - Don't worry I will help you
                + I will - I'll / you will - you'll / she will - she'll / we will - we'll
            4. With negative contractions, will not becomes won't:
                + Subject + will not / won't + infinitive
                    - He won't eat soup
                + He will not - He won't / They will not - They won't
            5. Questions: To form a question using WILL, we reverse the order of the subject and WILL:
                + Will + subject + infinitive:
                    - Will he watch  TV tonigh? No, he won't, He'll play videogames.
                    - Will you marry me? Yes I will
                    - Will she open the door? Please
                    - Will he be here tomorrow?
                    - Will they win the cup? No, They won't
                    - Will you tell him the truth? Yes, I will
            6. **Decisions** at the time to speaking: 
                An instant decision is one that we make based on current circumstances. When we must take a fast choice, this is an instant decision. These are not intentions for the future, but a decision we make quickly. For these instant decision we must use the simple future with WILL. We use WILL to express a decision we take at the moment of speaking:
                - I feel tired. I won't go to the party.
                - I won't stay for dinner. I think I'll go home early.
                - I'm hungry , I'll make myself a sandwich

                - I will have a cup of coffe, please.
                - I will call her tonight
            7. Offers, promises, predictions:
                1. Offers: Will often suggests that a speaker will do something voluntarily. A voluntary action is one the speaker offers to do for someone else. Often, we use "will" to respond to someone else's complaint or request for help. We also use "will" when we request that someone help us or volunteer to do something for us. Similarly, we use "will not" or "won't" when we refuse to voluntarily do something.
                    - I will send you the information when I get it.
                    - Will you help me move this heavy table?
                    - I won't do all the housework myself.
                    - I'll get you 
                    - Dont worry. I will help you with your homework.
                    - I will love you forever.
                    - You will be rich
                2. Promises: Will is usually used in promises:
                    - She won't agree whit that. No estará de acuerdo con eso.
                    - I will call you when I arrive.
                    - If I am elected President of the United States, I will make sure everyone has access to inexpensive health insu rance.
                    - I promise I will not tell him about the surprise party.
                    - Don't worry, I'll be careful.
                    - I won't tell anyone your secret.
                3. TO Refuce to do something:

                    - This homework is too difficult I won't do it .
                4. An assumption[suposición]
                    - The journey will take around twenty minutes.[El viaje tomara alrededor de 20 minutos.]
                    - I think you will like these flowers.
                5. A fact:
                    - He will get be twenty three next Monday.
    - Be going to for predictions:
        * We can also use be going to predict something you know or can see is going to happen. e.g Look at the clouds. It's going to rain. They're playing very well. I'm sure they ́re going to win.

* Examples:
    - I'm seeing Jane at 6. She'll be late
    - The movie is in French. We won't understand anything.
    - It's a great book. I'm sure you'll like it.

## Pronunciation
* How to make the UH Vowel sound /ʌ/.
    - sometimes/'sʌm taImz/ _stressed_ [Uhh]
    - money/'mʌn i/[uhh] _stressed_ [Uhh]
    - above/ae'bʌv  _stressed_ [Uhh] 
    - untie/ʌn'taI/ unstressed [Uhntie]
    - uphil/ʌp'hIl/ unstressed [Uhp'hil]
    - fun/fʌn/ _stressed_ [fuhn]

* THE LONG AND SHORT U SOUND:
    The vowel system is the most complicated part of the pronunciation-spelling system of English, because each vowel letter represents three or four different vowel sounds. The letter “U” has three different sounds, but one thing that is unique about “U” is that it has two Long-vowel sounds.

    The basic sounds of the English letter “U” are: Long-U-1, Long-U-2, and Short-u.

    * Long-U-1: The sound of Long-U-1 is the same as the name of the letter “U”. However, this long-vowel sound is a little bit unusual because Long-vowels usually have two parts, but Long-U-1 has three parts (in IPA: /yuw/). Some common words with this sound are: use / music / huge / cute / unite[yuwnite] / cure / menu[menuw] / fuel[fyuwl] / human[hyuwman] and argue[argyuw].

    * Long-U-2: The second Long-U sound is almost the same as Long-U-1, except that it has only two parts (in IPA: /uw/). Some words with this sound are: true / flute / blue / June / spruce / tune / rule / tube / duty[duwty]-deber and include.

    * Short-u: (like o))Short-u is pronounced in the center (not front, not back) middle (not high, not low) part of the mouth, and the tongue needs to be relaxed. Some common words with this sound are: up / just / but / much / under / us  run / study / number and because.

* The schwa sound /ə/.
    - communication-cəmunicəshion
    - traditional-trədicəonal
    - diet/dait/
    - The reduced vowel sound[El sonido vocalico reducido] called schwa is the most common vowel sound in spoken English. Schwa is a quick, relaxed, neutral vowel pronunciation very close to a _'short u'_ /ʌ/.  [Schawa es una pronunciación vocalica rapida, relajada y neutra muy cercana a]
    - The purpose of schwa is to allow unstressed syllables to be said more quickly so the main beats of spoken words are easier to place on the stressed syllables. [El proposito de schwa es permitirnos que las silabas no acentuadas se digar más rapidamente para que el sonido principal de las palabras habladas sean más fáciles de colocar en las silabas acentuadas.]
    - Schwa does not have an exact and standard pronunciation. Due to the near-identical pronunciation of schwa and short u, [Debido a la pronunciación casi idéntica de] many dictionaries merge[fusionan] the transcription of the two sounds and strictly use /ə/.
    - Separate symbols are retained[Los símbolos se mantienen separados aquí para indicar] here to indicate whether a vowel sound falls on a stressed or unstressed syllable[Cae en una silaba acentuada o no acentuada]. 
    - Schwa occurs in two different circumstances: [Se produce en]
        1. in an unstressed syllable of a multi-syllable word
        2. as a reduced vowel sound in a function word [Como un sonido vocalico reducido en una palabra funcional]

    * ### Schwa in an unstressed syllable    

        *  In words with more than one syllable, not every syllable is given equal emphasis when spoken. Three levels of *syllable stress*[acento silábico] are possible: [no todas las silabas reciben el mismo énfasis cuando las hablamos]

            1. stressed /⬤/
            2. secondarily stressed /●/
            3. unstressed /•/

        * Every multi-syllable word has a single[única] stressed syllable. The single stressed syllable of the word has the most emphasis. The remainder[resto] of the syllables may have a secondary stress[acento secundario] or may be unstressed[pueden ser no acentuadas]. The word emphasize[acentuada] has all the levels of stress.[niveles de acento].

        * The word emphasize has all the levels of stress. The first syllable is stressed, the second syllable is an unstressed syllable pronounced as schwa, and the third syllable has a secondary stress.
            * em•pha•size
            * /⬤ • ●/
    * ### The spellings of Schwa

        - Many multi-syllable words do not seem to be pronounced as they are spelled.[no parecen ser pronunciadas como se escriben] This is because schwa is a function of syllable stress and not of spelling[Es una función del acento silábico y no de la ortografía]. Once learners can recognize stressed syllables, it becomes easier to predict when schwa will be used in an adjacent, unstressed vowel[será más facil predecir cuando se usara _Schwa_ en una vocal adyacente no acentuada.], regardless of the spelling.[Independientemente de la ortografía]

        - The examples below show schwa as it is exhibited when spelled with each vowel. They syllable containing schwa is bolded:
            + 'a' spelling:
                - **a**gain: /ə 'gɛn/
                - vit**a**min: /'vɑɪ t̬ə mɪn/
            + 'e' spelling:
                - p*e*tition: /pə ˈtɪʃ ən/
                - cel*e*brate: /ˈsɛl ə breɪt/
            + 'i' spelling
                - pres*i*dent: /ˈprɛz ə dɛnt/
                - exper*i*ment: /ɪk 'spɛr ə mənt/
            + 'o' spelling

* Pronunciation of "ʤ"
    - The /ʤ/ sound is made through the mouth and it is Voiced which means that you vibrate your vocal chords to make the sound. It is defined by shape of your lips and the position of your tongue and it is an affricate, which is a sound made by closing the air flow but then opening it by forcing air through a narrow space. In this case it is the tip of your tongue that creates the narrow space between it and the ridge behind the teeth. To produce the sound touch your tongue to that ridge lightly and allow air pressure to force the tongue down whilst voicing out.

        • just /dʒəst/
