> ***_Create new  neural connection._***


## Focus vs Diffuse Mode

* Two ways of learning: Each helps us learn but in very different ways.
1. *Diffuse mode*
2. *Focus mode*

- When you're learning something new (especially something that's a little more difficult:
_your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the two different learning modes_ 
Because your brain needs to alternate it's ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material. (a medida que se enfrenta y asimila el nuevo material.)

* "To build neural structure": You need to do a little work every day, 

## Procrastinate, memory and sleep :timer:

_Create new  neural connection._

- You are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap(siesta). It is if you went to bed with one brain and woke up with an upgrade.

- When you look at something that you really rather not do, itseems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with _pain_. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that **neurodiscomfort disappeared**. So it seems what happens when you procrastinate.

* it's important to practice with ideas and concepts your learning in math and science, just like anything else you're learning. To help enhance and strengthen the neural connection your making during the learning process. 

- Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you. Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice. **Practice Makes Permanent**

When you're **learning**, what you want to do is study something:
    * Study it hard by focusing intently. 
    * Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for a while.
During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. Your, your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry(secar). If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming -> your knowledge base will
look more like this, all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation.
