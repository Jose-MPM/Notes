# Writing
I'm going to talk about one book I have read one month ago, it's call 1984, it was written by George Orwell and published on 8 jule 1949 by Secker & Warburg in UK. It's about a man that live in a period of the world where the government have strict politcs and laws for example the people always had to be watched by your TV and devices that existed in those time and they always have to do the same.

I have read it one time, I liked it a lot because its made me think in how the world could be due to advances in technology or information can be modificated and hide new information
