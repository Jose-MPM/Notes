¬øWhat is Learning?  :interrobang: 

> ***_Create new  neural connection._***

## Focus vs Diffuse Mode

* Two ways of learning: Each helps us learn but in very different ways.
1. *Diffuse mode*
2. *Focus mode*

- When you're learning something new (especially something that's a little more difficult:
_your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the two different learning modes_ 
Because your brain needs to alternate it's ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material. (a medida que se enfrenta y asimila el nuevo material.)

* "To build neural structure": You need to do a little work every day, 

## Procrastinate, memory and sleep :timer: (Week 1)

_Create new  neural connection._

- You are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap(siesta). It is if you went to bed with one brain and woke up with an upgrade. 

* [brainfacts](http://www.brainfracts.org) To know more about the brain

- When you look at something that you really rather not do, itseems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with _pain_. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that **neurodiscomfort disappeared**. So it seems what happens when you procrastinate.

paloma -> m√°s de una opcion.
circle -> Only one.

* it's important to practice with ideas and concepts your learning in math and science, just like anything else you're learning. To help enhance and strengthen the neural connection your making during the learning process. 

- Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you. Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice. **Practice Makes Permanent**

When you're **learning**, what you want to do is study something:
    * Study it hard by focusing intently. 
    * Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for a while.
During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. Your, your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry(secar). If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming -> your knowledge base will
look more like this, all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation.

### About memory. :brain:

The two types of memory are related:

* Long term memory (memoria a largo plazo)
    > 
* Working memory
    > Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. Repetitions needed so that your metabolic vampires that is natural dissipating processes don't suck(succionar) those memories away. 

Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are
often involved in whatever you're learning about. When you encounter something new,
you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long-term memory, it often takes time and practice. 

* If you want to move that information into your long-term memory, it often takes time and practice. To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition. 

    > This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, but what you want to do is a space this repetition out. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference. Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening.


Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the prefrontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping. Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work. If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening, you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. If you go even further and set(mantienes) it in mind that you want to dream about the material it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it, still further. Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand. It somehow consolidate your memories into easier to grasp chunks, and now, time for a little **sleep.** 

### The importance of sleep. :zzz:

You might be surprised to learn that just plain being awake creates toxic products in your brain.
How does the brain get rid of these poisons? Turns out that when you sleep,
your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells.
It's like unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out.
So, sleep which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time is actually your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.

It seems that during sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. 


### Extra:
* There isn't, a simple way to keep yourself attending something that you're not interested in, you learn more by active engagement rather than passive listening.
* Having an enriched environment is, is, is even as an adult is going to help you.
* Rusty discovered which I think is incredibly important. That in the absence of an enriched environment exercise will also increase the number of new neurons that are being born and survive.
* It needs that moment of pause of, of using your muscles rather than your brain. To be able to process that information and to, and, and get the neurons working on it.
* Being in a creative environment, where other people are creative a way of, enhancing(mejorar) your own creativity.
* _advice_: Don't get hung up if you can't answer a question. Go on to the next, because you can always come back and in fact, often, the answer to the problem that was holding you back may actually pop in to your brain later on in the test. This is how our brains work, things work along parallel tracks. 
> That success isn't necessarily come by being smart... passionate and persistent. A lot of success in life is that passion and persistence, of really staying the course, staying working on it, and, not letting go. Not giving up, and the most important: * **LEARNING WITH FRESH NEW EYES**
#### Coment trash: 

### Summary week 1:
* In essence people have two fundamentally different modes of thinking that, we've labeled focused and diffuse. 
* tackie - combatir
* When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation, the course of living our daily life. It's often a good idea once you've focused directly on the situation. To let things settle back and take a bit more time. That way more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode. The thing is it often takes time for neural processing to take place, and time, as well, to build the new neural structures that allow us to learn something new. 
* It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics.
* Memory of course is an important aspect of learning. There are four slots in our working memory. Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind. In that sense working memory is like a not very good blackboard. Long term memory, on the other hand, is like a storage warehouse. If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long-term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up.
* It's never a good idea to cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day. Because that's like trying to build muscle by lifting weights all in one day there's no time for solid structures to grow. We've also learned that the importance of sleep and washing away the toxins that develop during our days activities. We want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep the night before cause its like trying to think with poison on the brain. And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping both improve our memory and our ability to learn. 
* And just as importantly (Y de igual importancia )

simon carnal porque el m√©todo cient√≠fico ta m√°s chato que t√∫ desde que no topa que esta "vida" es una pinche experiencia virtual pa dioses que prueban los alcances de su poder en esta realidad ficticia... t√©cnicamente todo es posible una vez que te liberes de la matrix falsa tetraedrica y lo mejor de todo es que tu mismo puedes corroborarlo! solo tienes que recordar qui√©n eres m√°s all√° del envase biol√≥gico 100% real no fake

est√° bien ching√≥n bro, puedes convertirte en un universo porque de hecho esto es como un criadero de universos uwu o puedes juntar un chingo de banda que conecte contigo y crear su propia matrix dentro de esta... o pasarte a la realidad de los dioses el eterico y echar desmadre con ellos (8 son chidos

si mae, la cosa es que nadie puede darte respuestas, tu eres la respuesta, neto, tu eres el porqu√© de TODO
como egoprograma en la matrix eres un emisor-creador de realidad... tu ego es un interfaz de tu esp√≠ritu en el juego y todo depende de qu√© tan chida este la se√±al entre los dos :3 la regla es que nada existe en realidad, existe si t√∫ quieres y para eso tienes que justificarlo con lenguaje, YEAH somos nuestra propia peli en full HD 4K rey, qu√© m√°s kieres

Disculpa, acabo de ver tu comentario jaja. Y bueno, empezar√© por el drama. El dolor es la droga del juego. El juego en s√≠..de ah√≠ el "karma"... el drama es una trampa del wey m√°s ching√≥n del juego, Bill, quien es el arquetipo del diablo. El juego se juega por arquetipos. En realidad √©l es un profe, no por nada es el m√°s ching√≥n del juego. Una de las trampas m√°s corrientes es caer en querer ser el bueno de la historia por ejemplo. Como nada existe en realidad a menos que quieras, en ese momento creas a la v√≠ctima... y al victimario por default. As√≠ es, el h√©roe le da todo el poder a lo torcido. Es como si estuvieras proyectando tu propia peli y a la vez escribi√©ndola con tu subconsciente en autom√°tico. Hacer ese proceso consciente es clave. Mientras no seas consciente te mueves entre bucles de tiempo y eso es lo fake. Por eso hay bugs, si la matrix no fuera fake no los habr√≠a. Qu√© es la matrix? Una simulaci√≥n superpuesta a la matriz original, con infinitas ramificaciones fake en las que te puedes quedar atrapado si no rompes el loop. C√≥mo? Siendo genuino, volviendo poco a poco a tu l√≠nea de tiempo original. El tiempo es el bucle de los bucles.
Para pasar al modo dios es necesario entrar al nivel de percepci√≥n del sin tiempo. Salir del concepto de karma y abrir espacio. Hacerte menos denso, m√°s ligerito. Soltar. Apegos, objetos, personas, necesidades, obsesiones, rencores, traumas... Sueltas y en autom√°tico das, en autom√°tico recibes. Eso por lo f√°cil. Pero lo m√°s cabr√≥n es soltarte a t√≠ mismo, es decir, morir. Una vez que tienes ese POV m√°s panor√°mico y completo no puedes volver igual, muchas cosas cambian. No es igual en todos los casos, puede variar mucho pero con algunos basta estar muy cerca de la muerte para efectuar el cambio, lsd, hongos, dM+... para otros puede suceder que se tiene la experiencia de una muerte muy v√≠vida jaja... pero regresan enteros y hasta m√°s fuertes del viaje...
As√≠ es... la consciencia del esp√≠ritu es una vivencia de lo m√°s personal...
