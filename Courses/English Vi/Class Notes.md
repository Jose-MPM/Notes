# English Class Notes VI

## Speaking Unit 2

* Hello teacher! I'm Jose Manuel, I'm a computer science student and I only have online classes so I don't have to go to school but I have to pay all my attention in my classes otherwise I won't understand anything, I have to study a lot and very well because I think my subjects are heavy and even if I don't have to take classes on Saturdays, I must to do school stuff on weekends to survive cause I like to get a good average.

In my online classes I don't have to turn on my camera but I must mute my microphone unless I am going to participate in the class, I don't have to go to the library because I can find all the necessary material on the internet and in my research I must refer to the pages used and in my exams I must not use any translator or any material on the internet.

e.g. arrival, homewok, microphone, camera, library, classes on Saturday, research, exams etc.
