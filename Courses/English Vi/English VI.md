* Gerunds: The gerund is the base form of the verb + ing. It can be affirmative (e.g. going) or negative (e.g. not going).
	
	- A gerund is a noun made from a verb by adding "-ing." The gerund form of the verb "read" is "reading." You can use a gerund as the subject, the complement, or the object of a sentence.

### Can be used with a gerund or infinitive, e.g., 

- It started raining. (empezó a llover) It started to rain.
- I continued to work = I continued working

- Because We can use both as the subject or complement of a sentence but gerunds usually sound more like normal, spoken English, whereas infinitives sound more abstract. 
	- gerunds sound more natural and would be more common in everyday English
	- Infinitives emphasize the possibility or potential for something and sound more philosophical. 
	- Only remember that 90% of the time, you will use a gerund as the subject or complement of a sentence. 
	- look: 
		+ Learning is important. normal subject
    	+ To learn is important. abstract subject - less common
    	+ The most important thing is learning. normal complement
    	+ The most important thing is to learn. abstract complement - less common

- As the object of a sentence, it is more difficult to choose between a gerund or an infinitive. In such situations, gerunds and infinitives are not normally interchangeable[/inerchang-able]. Usually, the main verb in the sentence determines whether you use a gerund or an infinitive.
	- look:
		+ He enjoys swimming. "Enjoy" requires a gerund.
    	+ He wants to swim. "Want" requires an infinitive.

- Some verbs are followed by gerunds as objects. 
	+ She suggested going to a movie
	+ Mary keeps talking about her problems.(SIGUE HABLANDO)

- Some verbs are followed by infinitives.
    + She wants to go to a movie.
    + Mary needs to talk about her problems.

- some verbs are special:	
	+ stop 
		- \+ gerund: used when the thing that u stop is the second verb
			- I stopped studying
		- \+ to \+ infinitive: Used when u stop something else in order to do the second verb 
			- I stopped to have lunch
	+ remember
		- \+ gerund: used about memories of the past
			- He remembers going to the seaside(playa) when he was six.
			- I remember locking the door.
		- \+ to \+ infinitive: Used when u someone has to remember something that they have to do.
			- Please remember to buy some meat.
			- I remembered to bring your book.
	+ Try
		- \+ gerund: used when we do the verb, but it doesn't help us in some other goal
			- I tried to open the window, but it was too heavy
			- I tried to eat salad every day but I couldn't.
		- \+ to \+ infinitive: Used when we dont succeed in doing the verb
			- I tried opening the window, but the room was still too hot.
			- I tried eating salad every day, but I didn't lose any weight.

- We use the bare infinitive:
	1. After modal verbs: can, could, will, would, may, might-podría, shall-debería, should, must
		- She can speak great English
		- it may rain at the weekend
		- I might be late home today.

Es normal caer en los excesos sin apreciar la virtud de la moderación. Los vicios son una falta de respeto a la prudencia. La carencia es una falta de respeto a las necesidades. NO IGNORES LAS MODERACIONES.

El vulgo se deja seducir siempre por la apariencia y el éxito

Diogenes: Si llega a ti algo que va pasado, extiende la mano y sirvete moderamente, si pasa de largo, no lo retengas. Si aún no viene no exhibas tu deseo y espera hasta que llegue a ti. Así con tus hijos, con tu mujer, con los cargos, con la riqueza y algún día serás digno de participar en el banquete digno de los dioses. Pero si no te sirves de lo que te ofrecen, sino que lo desprecias ent no solo participaras del banquete de los dioses sino también de su poder. **Manual de vida.**
