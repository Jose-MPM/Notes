* Gerunds: The gerund is the base form of the verb + ing. It can be affirmative (e.g. going) or negative (e.g. not going).
	
	- A gerund is a noun made from a verb by adding "-ing." The gerund form of the verb "read" is "reading." You can use a gerund as the subject, the complement, or the object of a sentence.

### Can be used with a gerund or infinitive, e.g., 

- It started raining. (empezó a llover) It started to rain.
- I continued to work = I continued working

- Because We can use both as the subject or complement of a sentence but gerunds usually sound more like normal, spoken English, whereas infinitives sound more abstract. 
	- gerunds sound more natural and would be more common in everyday English
	- Infinitives emphasize the possibility or potential for something and sound more philosophical. 
	- Only remember that 90% of the time, you will use a gerund as the subject or complement of a sentence. 
	- look: 
		+ Learning is important. normal subject
    	+ To learn is important. abstract subject - less common
    	+ The most important thing is learning. normal complement
    	+ The most important thing is to learn. abstract complement - less common

- As the object of a sentence, it is more difficult to choose between a gerund or an infinitive. In such situations, gerunds and infinitives are not normally interchangeable[/inerchang-able]. Usually, the main verb in the sentence determines whether you use a gerund or an infinitive.
	- look:
		+ He enjoys swimming. "Enjoy" requires a gerund.
    	+ He wants to swim. "Want" requires an infinitive.

- Some verbs are followed by gerunds as objects. 
	+ She suggested going to a movie
	+ Mary keeps talking about her problems.(SIGUE HABLANDO)

- Some verbs are followed by infinitives.
    + She wants to go to a movie.
    + Mary needs to talk about her problems.

- some verbs are special:	
	+ stop 
		- \+ gerund: used when the thing that u stop is the second verb

			- I tried to eat salad every day but I couldn't.
		- \+ to \+ infinitive: Used when we dont succeed in doing the verb
			- I tried opening the window, but the room was still too hot.
			- I tried eating salad every day, but I didn't lose any weight.

- We use the bare infinitive:

		- it may rain at the weekend
		- I might be late home today.

## FIRST CONDITIONAL

* The fisrt conditional is called the future real conditional. It is for future actions.When we are thinking about a possible situation in the future, we use:
	- If + Present verb, future verb

* This structure is common when talking about possible plans, promises, warnings, threats or for persuading someone. We are predicting a likely result in the future if a condition is fulfilled.
	- If + Simple Present, Will / Won't ...
		- If I go to Paris next month for work, I'll visit the Eiffel Tower (Plans)
		- If I have time, I will help you. (Promise)
		- If you touch that wire, you will get an electric shock. (Warning)
		- If you eat my chocolate that is in the fridge, you'll sleep outside with the  dog.  (Threat)
		- If you take me to the mall, I'll buy you an ice cream. (Persuasion)

* FIRST CONDITIONAL STRUCTURE
	- **If  +  Subject  +  Simple Present  +  Subject  +  Simple Future**.
		+ Notice how we use a **comma after** the present tense clause.
		+ Examples
			- If it rains, I will wear a jacket.
			- If he goes to the game, he will buy a ticket at the stadium.
			- If she doesn't go to university, her parents won't be happy.
			- If it rains, we will cancel the trip.
			- If that candidate becomes President, the country will be in trouble.
			- If I win the competition, I will donate half of the prize money to charity.

	- We can also reverse the order and use:
		- Future Verb + If + Present Simple
			* Notice how the comma is not necessary with this word order.
			* Examples
				- I will very bussy if my teacher english let homework
				- U will not get a better job if u dont learn english
				- U will miss the bus if u dont hurry
				- the dog will bite u if u pull its tail
				- My mother will be angry if i dont finish the job.
				- What will u do if they fire u?

* Normally WILL is used in the main clause of first conditional sentences. However you can also use the modal verbs MAY, MIGHT and COULD when something is a possible consequence (and not a certain one) in the future.
	- If you are nice to me, I may buy you a gift when I'm in Peru.
	- If they train a little harder, they might win the match.
	- If he doesn't do his work, he could get fired.

* USES: 
	- The first conditional is used for actions in the future that depend on other events. For example:
 		- If he works on Friday, we will go shopping on Saturday.
 			- This means the shopping won’t happen if the working doesn’t happen.
 			- Shopping is dependent on working.
 	- Often "when" is used to show future plans. 
		- When he arrives, we will eat dinner.
		- I will buy a car when I find a job.
* More examples:
	- If - present simple - Subject - will do
		- If u fall in love with me I will not talk to you.
		- If it rains tomorrow we will stay at home.
		- If you kiss her she will become a princess
	- Subject - will do - If - present simple
		- I will drive to school If u lend me your car
		- He won't pass the exam if he doesn't study more
		- David will come to the party if he feels well. 

* The if separete the conditional of the consequenses
* e.g. example given
* ' aphostrofe
* be in second conditionals
	- we can use were instead was in I, he,she, it.
* second conditional: for imaginary or hipothetical situations.

* animals: 
	- a chicken
	- a horse
	- a monkey
	- snake
	- a leon

### Second conditional

* Use of 2nd conditional: When we are talking about a situation in the present or future that is hypothetical, unlikely or impossible. we use:
	- If + past simple, ...Would+verb

The second conditional is called **the present unreal conditional**. It's for hypothetical activities.
* If i had money, I would buy a car.
* If he were 16, he could drive

* Uses:
	- Unreal situation in the present
		- If i were the teacher. 
		- If i WERE an animlathe teacher. 
	- Imaginare events
		- If I were rich, I would buy a private jey
		- I would sleep more if i had time.
	- impossible present situations
		- I would go to the party, if I didn't have to work.
		- If I could play piano, I would play for you.
	- If I were: Note that with the verb To Be we use IF + I / HE / SHE / IT + WERE. The reason we use WERE instead of WAS is because the sentence is in the Subjunctive mood.
		- If I were not in debt, I would quit my job.
		- If he were taller, he'd be accepted into the team.
		- She would be still be correcting my grammar if she were still alive.
	- COULD can be used instead of WOULD to make the hypothetical present or future more likely.
		- •      If he trained every day, he could represent his country
		- •      If I had a little more money, I could buy a caR
			- Si tuviera un poco
		- •      If I were rich, I would not work.
		- •      If he were older, he would understand.
			- SI el fuera mayor
	- Second Conditional Questions
		-      What would you do if you were me?
		-      If you had $1,000, what would you buy?
		-      If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you want to live?
		-      Who would you like to meet, if you could meet anyone?
		-      Would she come if I paid for her flight?
		-      Would you accept the job if they offered it to you?
		- What would you do if you won the lottery?
		-      What would you do if you saw a U.F.O?
		- Notice that the questions are unreal situations. In the examples, it is clear that it is impossible to live anywhere in the world or meet anyone in the world.
	- Examples:	
		- They'd stick up for me-Ellos sacarían la cabeza por mí.
		- I'd kick it with who i wanted-Me divertiría con quien yo quiera
