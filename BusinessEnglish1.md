## The CEO

- how is the process of RESIGNING? How do u leave in good terms if your colleagues don't want u to do? 
	- only resigh when u r one hundred percent sure
		- "In my 15 years working in investment banking, I have seen people who have resigned and then changed their minds. And it almost always ends in tears".
	- three pieces of advice:
		- Don't tell them where u're going
		- Don't get emotional
		- Do not change ur mind
- Monopoly power: when u cant choise, a monopoly is a company that is the only supplier of a good(bien) or service in a specific market, it faces no competition.
	- They always and everywhere screw(joden) the consumer, they are a failure of capitalism, and u, me  and all other customers suffer. Because we have nowhere else to go
		- We have no choise but to use the monoplies' service, no matter how bad or expensive they are. (No tenemos más remedio que utilizar los servicios de los monopolios. No importa lo malos o caros que sean...)

- Countable vs Uncountable
	- Common mistake using ADVICE:
		- advice is an uncountable noun, it can not be used in the plurar
			- she gave a lot of good advice
			- she gave me three pieces of advice
		- error: 
			- a lot of advices
			- she gave me three advices

- interesting idiom(expresión idiomática): TO PULL SOME STRINGS(cuerdas), is used referring to power and influence in business life 
	- To pull some strings means that r secretly using ur power and influence to manipulate a situation.
		- The terms come from puppetry, so puppets or marionettes are manipulated by the means(significado) of strings(cuerda) that are held(sostenidos) by the puppet master(titiritero).

## The new boos

	- They r the owner or manager of a business enterprise, who, by risk and iniciative(mediante), attempt(intentan) to make profits(obtener beneficios).
		- RISK: Enterpreneurs risk-arriesgan their money, their time, and sometimes their health.
		- INICIATIVE: Enterpreneurs try to create something completely new.

* phrasal verbs 
	- goes off: this is when one machine activates, that are set to do something
		- an alarm goes off: it start to ring, 
	- **run through**: repasando 
		- to run through something, this means to review or rehearse(ensayar) the details of a process or a sequence.
		- example:
			-  He was **running through** all the issues. 
			-  You run through the issues of your upcoming day.
				- Tu repasas los asuntos del día que tienes por adelante, por venir.
	- deal with: take action in order to solve problem.
		- So whenever your boss asks you about a process, use this phrasal verb. I'm dealing with it. Whenever your boss asks you about a problem, use this phrasal verb. I'm dealing with it. It's music to the ears of any manager.

	- misfit:inadaptado

* idioms: 
	- If you feel like you don’t belong in a certain environment, you might be a **ROUND PEG IN A SQUARE HOLE**. UNA CLAVIJA REDONDA EN UN AGUJERO CUADRADO
		-  So when you refer to someone as a round peg in a square hole, what you're saying is that they don't fit. They are not right for the task. And in a business context, you use it to describe someone who doesn't fit into a corporate culture. 
	-  If you don’t accept the traditional way of doing things, then you are a person that likes to **CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO**.
		- the status quo is how things are, what has been established, we've always done them this way. It's a preference that things stay the same.
		- And it can be very comforting because it's easy. It doesn't require us to challenge ourselves. It doesn't require us to take risks and potentially make mistakes. The problem is, in modern professional life, if you don't challenge the status quo, someone else will. And you, your company, even your whole industry could be left behind.
